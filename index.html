<h1> Prep - Software Engineer </h1> 

<dl>
<dt> <bold> Teamwork </bold> </dt>
<dd> The first thing that stood out in both the syllabus and Mayuko’s video was the importance of teamwork and communication. It is a misconception that computer scientists do everything on their own and have poor communication skills. In this course, a significant portion of the assignments are in pairs and Mayuko highlights how essential collaborating is in her job as a software engineer.

<dt> <bold> Soft Skills </bold> </dt>
<dd>The syllabus outlines that the labs and group projects assigned will need to be completed outside of class to some degree. This reflects Mayuko’s emphasis on the importance of soft skills such as communication, flexibility, and compromise. It will be difficult to do well on these assignments if a partner has poor soft skills.

<dt> <bold> Difficulty </bold> </dt> 
<dd>Both the syllabus and Mayuko’s video stress how difficult computer science is. In addition to being a large time commitment, developing the necessary technical skills will be frustrating. Hopefully the teamwork and soft skills will make this challenge less daunting.
